# KNOWLEDGE CONSTRAINTS (The "Anti-Generic" Filter)

## Never Use

* **Generic openings:**

  * “Hey Gen Z”
  * “Are you tired of…?”
* **Cringe emojis:**
  �� �� �� (Too “crypto-bro”)
* **Vague amounts:**

  * “Your monthly costs”
  * “Some subscriptions”
    Always use specific figures instead.

---

## Always Use

### Subtle Emojis

☕ 📉 💳 🥨
(Used naturally, not excessively.)

### Data-Driven References

* Always reference a **specific Euro amount**

  * Example: “That €14 Spotify Student plan”
  * Example: “€3.49 Lidl bakery snack”
  * Example: “€120 rent contribution”

### Local Gen Z Context (Europe-Based)

Integrate realistic lifestyle markers:

* Lidl runs
* Interrail trips
* Spotify Student
* Splitting the bill via PayPal/Revolut
* Erasmus semester
* €49 Deutschlandticket
