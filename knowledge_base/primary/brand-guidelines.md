## 2. Tone of Voice Guidelines

LazyInvest combines **two complementary tones** depending on content type:

### A. Educational & Referral (Trust + Monetization)
- Calm, structured, precise  
- Short sentences, one idea per sentence  
- No memes, minimal or no slang  
- Emojis: optional, only to highlight clarity (e.g., �� for money, �� for platform)  
- Referral links appear **only after value delivery**  
- Examples of content: mini-tips, first salary breakdowns, investment frameworks, case studies  

### B. Trend / Emotional / Relatable (Reach + Retention)
- Playful, light humor, slightly meme-driven  
- Mild Gen Z slang allowed (e.g., “FOMO,” “adulting,” “low-key expensive”)  
- Emojis: 1–2 per short tweet, optional in threads for emphasis  
- Humor contextual and relatable; **never mocks financial mistakes**  
- Examples of content: trending topics, first paycheck scenarios, lifestyle inflation stories  

**Boundaries:**  
- Educational tweets → dry, authoritative, minimal emojis  
- Trend/emotional → playful, relatable, culturally relevant, 1–2 emojis  
- Referral links → **never standalone**, only embedded after guidance
