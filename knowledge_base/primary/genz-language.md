# Gen Z Language & Communication Patterns

## How Gen Z Talks About Money

Gen Z doesn't use traditional finance language. They reframe money concepts in their own terms:

| Traditional Term | Gen Z Version |
|---|---|
| Budget | "Knowing where my money goes" |
| Emergency fund | "My oh-shit money" |
| Investment portfolio | "Putting my money to work" |
| Financial planning | "Adulting with money" |
| Compound interest | "Your money making money while you sleep" |
| Diversification | "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" |
| Inflation | "Everything's getting more expensive and my salary isn't" |
| Net worth | "What I actually have" |
| Disposable income | "Fun money" / "What's left" |

## Common Slang (Use Sparingly, Must Feel Natural)

- **lowkey** — subtly, kind of ("lowkey need to check my bank account")
- **no cap** — for real, honestly ("no cap, that subscription is draining you")
- **hits different** — feels significant ("seeing your savings grow hits different")
- **vibe check** — reality check ("vibe check on your spending this month")
- **main character energy** — taking control ("main character energy is knowing your numbers")
- **rent free** — occupying your thoughts ("that €200 impulse buy living rent free in your head")
- **it's giving** — it resembles ("that budget is giving organized")
- **slay** — doing great ("slay your savings goals")
- **sus** — suspicious ("hidden fees are sus")
- **W / L** — win / loss ("auto-saving €50/month is a silent W")

## Communication Style

- **Short-form first:** Gen Z prefers bite-sized info. Lead with the punchline, explain after
- **Authenticity over polish:** slightly messy > perfectly corporate
- **Screenshots and relatability:** "POV: you check your bank account after the weekend" resonates
- **Humor as entry point:** make them laugh first, teach second
- **Stories over stats:** "My friend spent €80 on Uber Eats last month" > "Studies show millennials spend 30% more on delivery"
- **Questions that trigger self-reflection:** "When's the last time you checked your subscriptions?" > "You should review your subscriptions"

## Topics That Resonate

- First paycheck excitement → "now what?"
- Splitting bills with flatmates / friends
- The guilt of spending on yourself
- Feeling behind compared to peers
- "I'll figure it out later" procrastination
- Side hustle culture vs. just managing what you have
- The gap between what you earn and what things cost
- Parents' financial advice that doesn't apply anymore
