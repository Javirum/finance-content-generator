## Single Tweets

**On saving:**
Your savings account doesn't care if you start with €500 or €5. It just cares that you start.

**On subscriptions:**
You're paying for 4 streaming services and watching the same 3 shows on Netflix. That's €30/month doing nothing. Audit your subs this weekend.

**On first paycheck:**
First paycheck rule: before you touch it, move 10% somewhere you can't easily grab it. Future you will be grateful, present you won't even notice.

**On investing fear:**
"I don't have enough to invest." You have €25? You have enough. One ETF share. That's it. You're an investor now.

**On eating out:**
Cooking 3 more meals a week instead of ordering saves you ~€120/month. That's a weekend trip to Porto in 3 months.

**On BNPL:**
Klarna makes it feel like free money. It's not. It's you borrowing from next month's you. And next month's you also has rent.

**On budgeting:**
You don't need a spreadsheet with 47 categories. Just know 3 numbers: what comes in, what goes out, what's left. That's your entire budget.

**Thread: "The Subscription Trap"**

1/ You probably spend more on subscriptions than you think. Let's do a quick count: Spotify, Netflix, gym, phone, cloud storage, YouTube Premium, that app you forgot about...

2/ The average Gen Z in Europe spends €25-40/month on subscriptions. That's €300-480/year. Not saying cancel everything — just know what you're actually paying for.

3/ Quick fix: check your bank statements from last month. Circle every recurring charge. Ask yourself: "Did I use this in the last 2 weeks?" If no, cancel it. You can always resubscribe.

4/ The goal isn't to live like a monk. It's to only pay for things that actually make your life better. That's not restriction — that's being smart with YOUR money.

## Anti-Examples (What NOT to sound like)

**Too formal:** "It is advisable to allocate a portion of your monthly earnings toward a diversified investment vehicle."

**Too preachy:** "If you stopped buying avocado toast and lattes, you could retire 5 years earlier."

**Too generic:** "Save money. Invest early. Budget wisely." (Says nothing, helps no one)

**Too salesy:** "With our exclusive financial toolkit, you can unlock your wealth potential TODAY! 🚀💰💎"
