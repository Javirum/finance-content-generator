# Gen Z Bank Statement Summaries

## Person 1: Alex Chen - First Full-Time Job

### Overview: Person and Life Situation

Alex Chen is a 22-year-old who recently transitioned from university life into the professional world as a Junior Marketing Coordinator. Living in a mid-size city, Alex shares an apartment with two roommates, embracing the typical young professional lifestyle of balancing work responsibilities with an active social life. This is Alex's first experience with a steady, full-time income, representing a significant shift from student budgets and part-time work. At this stage of life, Alex is navigating the challenge of managing a real salary while establishing independence, building a professional wardrobe, and maintaining the social connections that are central to Gen Z culture.

### Income

Alex's monthly income is straightforward, consisting of a single source: a net salary of €2,100 after taxes and deductions. This represents a typical entry-level position in the marketing field, providing a stable and predictable income stream. Unlike the student years, there are no supplementary income sources from parents, financial aid, or side hustles. The full-time employment offers financial independence but also comes with the responsibility of covering all living expenses without external support. This income level places Alex in a position where financial planning becomes crucial, as there's limited room for error without a safety net.

### Expenses and Expense Categories

Alex's monthly expenses total €2,100, exactly matching the income and leaving no surplus at the end of the month. Housing and utilities consume €625, with rent at €550 for a shared apartment being the single largest expense. Transportation costs of €145 reflect urban mobility through a combination of public transport (€65 monthly pass) and ride-sharing services for convenience. Food and groceries account for €385, split between home cooking (€220), workplace lunches (€55), coffee shop visits (€65), and food delivery services (€45). The subscription and entertainment category reveals a modern digital lifestyle at €127, including multiple streaming services (Spotify, Netflix, Disney+, YouTube Premium), a gym membership, gaming subscriptions, and occasional cinema visits. Shopping and personal care total €285, covering clothing purchases from fast-fashion retailers, skincare products, monthly haircuts, tech accessories, and home décor items. Social and lifestyle spending reaches €215, distributed across bars and clubs (€85), restaurant dinners (€75), gifts, and event tickets. Phone and internet costs €52, including both the mobile contract and a device payment plan. Health and wellness expenses of €45 cover pharmacy items and therapy co-pays. Positively, Alex allocates €150 toward savings and investments, with €100 going to emergency savings and €50 to ETF investments through Trade Republic. Miscellaneous expenses of €71 include ATM withdrawals, a late payment fee, and impulse online purchases.

### Analysis and Findings

Alex's financial situation reveals a common pattern among young professionals in their first full-time role: living exactly paycheck to paycheck despite earning a reasonable salary. While the income of €2,100 is respectable for an entry-level position, the complete absence of any monthly surplus indicates a lack of financial buffer and potential vulnerability to unexpected expenses. The analysis reveals several areas of concern and opportunity. First, discretionary spending is notably high, with €342 going toward subscriptions, entertainment, and social activities. This represents over 16% of total income spent on non-essential lifestyle choices. The €127 in subscription services alone could be optimized by auditing which services are actively used versus forgotten autopay commitments. Second, the convenience economy takes a significant toll, with €110 spent monthly on ride-sharing, scooter rentals, and food delivery services. These small, frequent transactions add up substantially and represent an area where behavioral changes could yield savings. Third, despite the tight budget, Alex demonstrates financial awareness by maintaining both emergency savings and investment contributions totaling €150 monthly. This 7% savings rate, while modest, shows positive financial habits forming early in professional life. However, the €100 emergency fund is insufficient to weather most financial shocks, such as unexpected medical costs, job loss, or major purchases. Fourth, the €71 in miscellaneous expenses, including a late payment fee, suggests some disorganization in financial management—a common challenge when juggling multiple subscriptions and automatic payments. The food spending pattern of €385 reveals a lifestyle heavily dependent on convenience, with nearly 43% of food costs going to coffee shops, work lunches, and delivery services rather than home-prepared meals. Overall, Alex's financial profile reflects a young professional enjoying newfound income freedom but not yet implementing the discipline needed to build long-term financial security. The complete spend-down of monthly income leaves no margin for error and indicates that lifestyle inflation has matched income growth. To improve financial health, Alex should focus on building a 3-6 month emergency fund, reducing subscription clutter, cooking more meals at home, and being more intentional about discretionary spending while maintaining the positive habit of consistent investing.

## Person 2: Maya Rodriguez - University Student

### Overview: Person and Life Situation

Maya Rodriguez is a 20-year-old second-year Business student navigating the demanding balance between academic responsibilities and financial independence. Living in a university city's student dormitory, Maya represents the typical Gen Z student experience: hustling across multiple income streams to make ends meet while pursuing higher education. Maya's life is characterized by careful budgeting, strategic use of student discounts, and the constant juggling act between studying, working part-time as a barista (15 hours per week), and taking on freelance social media projects. This stage of life requires significant resourcefulness and adaptability, as Maya manages to maintain a social life, invest in education, and even save money despite limited income and the ongoing expenses of university life.

### Income

Unlike many students who rely on a single source of funding, Maya has diversified income streams totaling €1,400 per month. The primary source is part-time employment as a barista, working approximately 15 hours weekly and earning €520 monthly. This provides both income and valuable work experience in customer service. Maya's parents contribute €400 monthly as financial support, representing a significant but not complete subsidy of living expenses. Government student financial aid (BAföG) adds €350 monthly, providing crucial support for basic needs. Additionally, Maya has developed a side hustle managing social media accounts for small businesses, bringing in €130 per month. This diversified approach to income demonstrates both entrepreneurial spirit and the reality that single income sources are often insufficient for today's students. The combination of earned income (€650 from work and freelancing) and support (€750 from parents and government aid) shows a balanced approach to funding university life, though it also highlights the financial pressures students face when traditional student jobs alone cannot cover living costs.

### Expenses and Expense Categories

Maya's monthly expenses also total €1,400, perfectly matching income with no surplus. Housing and utilities consume €385, with €320 for student dorm accommodation representing the single largest expense. While more affordable than private rentals, this still claims over 27% of monthly income. Additional housing costs include utilities (€35), laundry fees for shared machines (€15), and building WiFi (€15). Transportation expenses are relatively low at €55, as the semester ticket included in university fees covers most public transport needs. Costs here include bike repairs (€20), occasional late-night taxis for safety (€25), and infrequent train trips home (€10). Food and groceries account for €280, with Maya shopping primarily budget brands and discount stores (€165), supplemented by affordable university cafeteria meals (€45), coffee shops for study sessions (€35), weekend food delivery treats (€25), and bubble tea or snack purchases (€10). Education-specific expenses total €95, covering course materials and textbooks (€40), printing and copying (€12), online learning courses (€15), study supplies (€18), and university merchandise (€10). The subscription and entertainment category is lean at €68, including Spotify Student (€5.99), shared Netflix access (€4), Canva Pro for freelance work (€11.99), discounted university gym membership (€19.99), TikTok Shop impulse purchases (€15), and going out to parties (€35). Shopping and personal care totals €115, with a focus on budget-conscious choices: thrift store and Vinted clothing purchases (€40), drugstore cosmetics (€25), student-discount haircuts (€18), and a Shein fast-fashion order (€32). Social and lifestyle spending reaches €95, covering student bar nights (€45), pizza with friends (€25), a birthday brunch (€15), and club entry fees (€10). Phone and internet costs just €20 monthly, using a prepaid plan (€10) with occasional data top-ups (€10). Health and wellness expenses are €35, including pharmacy items and contraception (€20) plus vitamins (€15). Impressively, Maya maintains a €100 monthly savings contribution despite the tight budget. Miscellaneous expenses total €152, including ATM cash withdrawals (€60), Venmo and PayPal transfers for cost-splitting (€35), Amazon impulse buys (€28), setting aside money for a summer festival ticket (€25), and unfortunately a €4 overdrawn account fee.

### Analysis and Findings

Maya's financial situation illustrates both the challenges and resourcefulness characteristic of Gen Z university students. Despite living on €1,400 monthly—significantly less than a full-time salary—Maya demonstrates sophisticated financial management and strategic decision-making. The most striking finding is the diversification of income sources across four different streams, showcasing entrepreneurial initiative and an understanding that relying on a single source is risky and often insufficient. The part-time work and freelancing (€650 combined) covers nearly half of expenses, while parental support and government aid provide crucial stability. This hybrid model reflects the modern reality that traditional part-time student jobs alone cannot fund university life. Maya's expense management reveals deliberate cost-consciousness throughout. Housing in student dorms, while not luxurious, provides affordable accommodation at €320 compared to private rentals that could easily exceed €500-700. The transportation budget of €55 leverages the included semester ticket intelligently, minimizing costs while maintaining mobility. Food spending of €280 is notably controlled, with heavy emphasis on budget grocery shopping and strategic use of the university cafeteria rather than expensive restaurants. The education budget of €95 demonstrates investment in academic success beyond just tuition, including online learning to build marketable skills. Perhaps most impressive is Maya's commitment to saving €100 monthly (7.1% of income) despite financial constraints—a savings rate that many full-time workers fail to achieve. This shows financial discipline and long-term thinking unusual for this demographic. However, several vulnerabilities exist in Maya's financial situation. The complete reliance on all four income streams means that losing any single source—particularly parental support or BAföG—would create immediate hardship. The €100 emergency savings, while commendable, would likely take many months to build into a meaningful safety net. The €152 in miscellaneous expenses, including a bank overdraft fee, suggests occasional cash flow timing issues and the challenge of tracking numerous small transactions. The subscription spending of €68, while modest compared to working professionals, still includes some potential optimization opportunities, particularly the €15 spent on TikTok Shop impulse purchases. The social spending of €95 reflects the importance of maintaining friendships and university social life, but represents nearly 7% of income—a significant portion when finances are tight. The shopping pattern shows some tension between budget consciousness (thrifting, Vinted) and fast fashion impulses (€32 Shein order), indicating the influence of social media marketing on spending decisions. Maya's financial profile demonstrates remarkable resilience and planning, but also highlights systemic issues facing students: even with multiple income sources and careful budgeting, there's zero financial cushion month-to-month. The student experience requires constant financial vigilance and leaves no room for unexpected expenses. To improve financial security, Maya should focus on gradually increasing the emergency fund, potentially reducing subscription services, being more mindful of impulse purchases from social media platforms, and continuing to develop the freelance business as a scalable income source. The positive financial habits already established—diversified income, consistent saving, budget consciousness, and leveraging student discounts—provide a strong foundation for future financial health once Maya enters full-time employment post-graduation.
