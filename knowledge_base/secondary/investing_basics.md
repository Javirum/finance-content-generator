# Investing Basics for First-Time Investors (Germany)

## What is an ETF?

An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a fund that tracks a market index (e.g. MSCI World) and allows investors to buy many companies in one product.

## Why ETFs Appeal to Gen Z

- Low cost
- Simple setup via neobrokers
- Can start with €25–€50/month
- Passive investing model fits busy lifestyle

## Time Horizon & Compounding

- Long-term investing (10+ years)
- Small monthly amounts compound over time
- Example: €50/month at 7% return over 20 years ≈ €26,000+

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- Trying to time the market
- Panic selling during downturns
- Investing money needed short-term
- Over-diversifying too early

## Risk Reality

- Markets fluctuate
- Short-term losses normal
- Long-term growth historically positive

## Example Scenario

19-year-old earning €1,350 net.
Investing €50/month into MSCI World ETF.
Still allows room for lifestyle spending while building long-term habit.
