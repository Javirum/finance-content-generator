## What an ETF Is (Simple Definition)

An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a product that tracks a broad index.
Instead of buying one company, you buy a small piece of many companies in one bundle.

Key idea for beginners:
- ETFs = diversified by design (less “single-stock drama”)

---

## Why ETFs Fit Beginners

ETFs work well for beginners because they can be:
- Simple
- Diversified
- Long-term oriented
- Built around small monthly investing habits

---

## Monthly Investing: Default Examples

Use these examples when referencing investing amounts:

- Starter monthly investing habit: **€25–€50/month**
- More confident starter habit: **€75/month**

Core principle:
- Consistency matters more than intensity.

## Example Scenario (Use This as a Tweet Anchor)

Age 21, net income: **€1,700/month**
- Invests **€75/month** into a broad ETF
- Treats it like a recurring bill (automated habit)

Key message:
- Small, repeatable habits reduce decision stress.

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- Trying to time the market
- Panic selling during downturns
- Expecting quick results
- Investing money needed in the short term
- Following influencer hype instead of building a boring plan

---

## Risk Reality (Plain Language)

- Markets move up and down.
- Short-term drops are normal.
- Long-term investing is designed to ride out volatility.
- “Boring and steady” is a feature, not a bug.

---

## Emotional Barriers (What Stops Action)

- Fear of losing money
- Feeling unqualified (“I don’t understand it enough”)
- Decision paralysis (too many choices)
- Waiting for the “perfect time”

Supportive framing:
- You don’t need perfect knowledge to start a small habit.
- Starting small is a valid strategy.
