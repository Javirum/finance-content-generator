- First full-time net salary: **€1,300–€2,200/month**

Notes:

## Example Monthly Budget (Urban, Age 20)

Use this example as the default “realistic baseline scenario”:

Net income: **€1,600/month**

- Rent (shared flat): **€650**
- Transport pass: **€40–€70**
- Subscriptions (streaming/music/gym/cloud): **€70–€110**
- Groceries: **€200–€280**
- Eating out & delivery: **€180**
- Social life (bars, events, festivals): **€150–€250**
- Remaining at month-end: **€100–€200**

Interpretation:
- Savings rarely happen automatically.
- Savings often occur only if spending is planned intentionally.

## Behavioral Spending Patterns (What Actually Happens)

- **Payday spike:** spending increases in the first **5–7 days** after income arrives.
- **Reward spending:** purchases are used as relief after stress (work, exams, social pressure).
- **End-of-month clamp-down:** “survival mode” behavior (reduced spending, postponing purchases).
- **BNPL usage:** used for fashion and tech when cash feels tight.
- **Saving approach:** often “whatever is left,” not a set amount.

---

## Emotional Drivers (Why Decisions Happen)

- Inflation frustration (daily visible price increases)
- Fear of falling behind peers
- Strong travel/experience culture
- Desire for independence (especially moving out)
- Investing curiosity mixed with hesitation and overthinking

---

## Digital Finance Culture (How They Learn)

- Mobile-first preference for money management and investing
- Finance education comes mainly from short-form content (social platforms) and YouTube-style explainers
- Many distrust traditional finance language and “guru” tone
- Investing interest is often driven by simple, low-friction entry points (small monthly amounts)

## Content Rules (Use These in Generated Output)

When generating content:
- Include at least **one** realistic € number drawn from the ranges or the example budget above.
- Acknowledge **rent burden** or a trade-off at least once (money is constrained).
- Use a tone that validates emotions without shaming.
- Do NOT add new numeric claims beyond what’s provided here.
- Do NOT mention countries or policies unless the Primary KB explicitly adds them.
