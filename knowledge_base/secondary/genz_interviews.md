Being in your position, how much money can we make per month? I make between 45 and 50 currently. Around 100k plus. What do you do for a living? So I work for the British government in the treasury department. I've always been interested in politics. You're very close to the heart of politics, but sometimes it's ****. Is that a well-paid job? For my job, you can be well-paid, but I will not say that the food industry pays very well. For how much money you want to spend for a car? Maybe 2,000. 43 years old? You look so young. Nice lifestyle, you know. What kind of lifestyle are you in? Don't miss any beer and enjoy life. Your name, age and where are you from? My name is Stefan, I am 43 years old, I'm from Germany. 43 years old? How come? Yeah. You look so young. Nice lifestyle, you know. What kind of lifestyle are you in? Don't miss any beer and just enjoy life.

## Chunk 2

**0:01:01 - 0:02:02**

Don't miss any beer? Yes. Really? But you are not building up a belly? Yeah, you have to do sports, of course. And you are into fitness or what? No, just snowboarding, mountain biking, something like that. What do you do for a living? I'm a project manager. What type of business or industry is it? Aerospace business. For how long are you doing it? For one year now. So you shifted your career from something else? Yes, from the same company. I was an industrial manager before. Now I'm a project manager. That's great. And being in your position, how much can we make in Germany? Around 100k plus. That's great because you are into six figure income. How do you invest your money? I have a flat to pay for and yeah, doing vacation, living my life. That's most of it and the rest is some kind of investments. Is it like trading?

---

## Chunk 3

**0:02:02 - 0:03:03**

Trading as well, yeah. What type of investments are they? ETFs mostly, it's very conservative. It's not that gambling stuff. That's great. And are you getting high ROI from them? No, not that much. It's an average of 8%, something like that. So people in their early age, they want to be financially free. And what advice would you give to them? Buy a house early, start investing early, make some insurances very early. Not that high amount, but just start early to have a low rate, low monthly rate and if you just start late, your rate, your monthly rate is quite high and you will always have less money for your monthly, doing whatever you want to do, yeah. And at the end, being a six figure income earner, is that a secure job? I would say so, yeah.

## Chunk 4

**0:03:03 - 0:04:04**

I would say the aerospace industry, it was hard in the last years with the corona, but in between, I would say the future looks quite good. Everybody needs airplanes. I would say, yeah, it's a quite safe job. That's great. Thank you very much. Good luck on your career. And because you started recently, a year, I would say, yeah? Yeah. Okay, that's great. Thank you very much. Good luck. Thank you. Hello, your name, age and where are you from? My name is Ed Frost. My age is 34 and I'm from London. 34? No way. Indeed. How come? Moisturizer. You use a lot? Quite a bit. How about you? My name is Anisa Taranjan. How old am I? 29? Yeah, 29. I'm also from London. That's great. What do you do for a living? So I work in film for a company called Mubi in the marketing department. So like marketing films for release in cinemas. Is that a profitable career?

---

## Chunk 5

**0:04:04 - 0:05:06**

No, not really. What keeps you working there then? I really like independent film. So I get to work on really cool films. You are working in a marketing department and not related to the filming? I don't get to make the films. I get to sell the films, which is a whole different thing. You want to make your own film one day? Not really. I tried doing it at university. I wasn't very good at it. So I can sell, I can't make. What do you do for a living? So I work for the government, the British government. I work in the treasury. You are confirming with him before saying things or you are asking, what's going on? I think self-conscious in front of a camera, maybe. So I work for the British government in the treasury department. That's a nine to five job, I would say. A bit longer, like it's a bit, usually longer than that. It's a bit more intense, but yeah, a general nine to five. Are you happy with that? Ah, that's a difficult question. Yes. So being in your position, how much can we make for a year? I make between 45 and 50 currently, grand a year.

---

## Chunk 6

**0:05:06 - 0:06:07**

You are happy with that, with the salary wise, I mean. Salary, it's okay. It's livable in London, at least. Could be more, but it's not awful. Do you have any side hustle? No side hustle, but I should have a side hustle. What type of side hustle you would think about? I really like photography. So looking into doing that, whether that makes any money, probably not, but it's more of a passion than working for sure. That's great. The million dollar question came to you. How much money can we make in your position? I currently make 50, shit, I'm not sure. Again, she's confirming. No, I actually don't know. We just recently had a pay increase, but yeah, about like 55K, yeah. Is that okay for you? Like you are living comfortably? Yeah, it's fine, it's fine. I mean, I feel like it's a cost of living crisis everywhere. So, but we're in quite a lucky position that it's definitely livable in London. You're living together? Yes, yes. You're sharing everything? Yeah. So if you are going out for it,

## Chunk 7

**0:06:07 - 0:07:08**

who is paying the bills? You split it. Split it, yeah. Do you invest your money or no? No, I'm actually a terrible personal finance. I was just saying this the other day. I should probably, all my savings just sat gaining no interest. So I should probably do something about that. But. Do you have any savings? Some. For what? Well, it's just to pay off my mortgage. Oh, you have a mortgage already? Yeah. And do you also rent out? Well, I pay his rent, yeah. To him. He's my girlfriend and my landlord. Wow, you're the boss in a relationship. In a relationship. Sometimes. Sometimes, yeah. Yeah. Are you happy with that? I'm happy with that. We have a good dynamic. We have a good living dynamics. And in the future, let's say that he's quitting from his job. He wants to follow the passion, which doesn't pay the bills. Would you be happy with that? Yeah, sure. Within reason. I think it depends if it's affordable. Let's say that for a year, he doesn't work. He doesn't bring anything to the table. How happy would you be with that? I think it depends.

---

## Chunk 8

**0:07:08 - 0:08:09**

So you will? It's hard to say. Well, no, I think if it was affordable, then we could probably make something work for a period. For how long you would support him financially? I don't know. It's really hard to put a number on that. Depends on a lot of factors, right? Like how much is it affecting his happiness? If he doesn't pay the rent, if he doesn't pay the rent, when you will kick him off? Oh, that's fine. I feel like rent is, I think that's fine. That's great. How about you? You invest your money or no? I don't invest it. I don't really understand how to invest money. But I save it. Like Sonny, it just kind of sits in a savings account and not really does, just it collects interest and that's it. What's your biggest splurge? My biggest splurge in my whole life? Holidays. We're on holiday now. We go on two or three a year. Yeah, you probably do more. Holidays. You're traveling alone also? I travel alone, but also together. We do one or two together a year. Then I also go traveling,

## Chunk 9

**0:08:09 - 0:09:09**

either for work or just for like mini breaks into Europe. Let's say that in the future, you want to set up your business. What type of business would it be? I totally have thought about this. I would love to own a pub, which sounds very British, but I would love to be a pub proprietress. My mom actually, like my parents owned shops. That was like their business growing up and their business owners and have never wanted me to have a business from all the stress of having a business. But I love the idea of having like a local pub, knowing everyone in the community, but also probably never do that. Why? I dream. I think I like the idea of it, but I also think that I need to be intellectually stimulated at work. And I don't know if that will give me the intellectual stimulation that I have. With all politicians, when they win the party and then going for the pub to celebrate it. Yeah, maybe. Maybe that's the way to win some favor. That's a business idea. Well, God, trade market. What stops you not doing it? I don't know. Business is quite high risk. Being a civil servant is super like comfortable, quite safe job. And I do enjoy it as much as it's like a bit stressful. I might complain about it. Like I do.

---

## Chunk 10

**0:09:09 - 0:10:10**

I feel like public service is definitely where I see my future lying in terms of career. So maybe that's why. Then maybe when I retire. That's great. Well, thank you very much. Good luck on your relationship. On your career as well. We might need it, yeah. I enjoyed to talk to you. Hello, your name, age and where are you from? So my name is Melanie. I'm 27 and I'm from Paris. What do you do for a living? Working in supply chain for a food firm. For how long you're working there? Almost two years. Why did you decide for starting in this career? I don't know the challenges it has and working in the food industry always moving and fast paced environment, I would say. Is that a well-paid job? For my job, you can be well paid, but I will not say that the food industry pays very well. Being in your position, how much can we make per year? I think in euros, like around 45 to 50K a year. And which city you live in France? Paris. Paris, okay.

---

## Chunk 11

**0:10:10 - 0:11:11**

But is it enough to live in Paris with your, let's say covering all your expenses and living in your comfort zone? I can live very well. I mean, I can travel, I live by myself, pay all of the things I have to pay, but it can also be sometimes challenges if you want to save some money. How do you invest your money? I save it, I don't really invest it, but I only save it like in the bank account. Not sure it's the right way, but. Why do you save your money in a bank? I don't know, easiest way to do it, I'll say. But why you don't prefer cash? I don't know, I'm not used to having cash. I'm always paying by card. Let's say that you have cash and also the possibility to pay everything by cash and also the card payment, which one you prefer? Card payment. Why so? Easiest way, I don't have any change, don't have any, I would say bills and everything, you just pay the right amount and they don't give you money back. At the same time, you are also losing some money

---

## Chunk 12

**0:11:11 - 0:12:12**

on the transactions? Yeah, not really in France though. We don't pay any fees on the transaction by card, so it's quite the same if we pay by cash. What's your long-term goal? I don't know, maybe change country, live in another country. That's great. Do you want to start your own business? I don't know, I have thought of that, but I don't know, I also like to work in a company, so I don't know. If I have a good idea, maybe, but right now, not. You are happy with what you are doing, yes? Yeah, I like my job and I like the industry I'm working in, so it's fine for me for now. That's important. For people living in France, but they want to move away and to move another country, what advice would you give to them? I would say make some research, do not just pick a country because maybe you have heard some things or look some of the things on the Instagram, make your research and make sure that you can also find a job that you will like the country, you will say. But how about people thinking to go to France, what advice you would give to them? I would say try to learn a little bit of French.

---

## Chunk 13

**0:12:12 - 0:13:12**

A lot of people, we are more eager to speak English, but a lot of people still do not speak English, so I would say French. Speaking French is like a plus. Is it because they don't want to speak in English or they don't know how to speak English? I would say some did not learn it at school, but now it's mandatory to learn it at school, but some people are also a little bit ashamed of the French accent we have in English, so they are not really eager to speak English. I got it. For people, let's say they are in early 20s, they want to start in supply chain industry, what advice you would give to them? I would say don't be afraid. A lot of supply chain job can be learned at the job and it also change from companies to companies and you can also learn a lot on the internet with online training, so just don't be afraid and if you like it, then start it. Great. What is the best piece of information you ever learned in your entire career? To be proactive and not be afraid of any challenges.

What do you do for a living? I'm a finance clerk. Finance clerk? Wow, for how long you are working in that position? Six months. Is that a profitable career? Yes, I would say so. Why did you choose that career? I like accounts and I've always liked, so I thought I pursue finance. That's great. Being in your position, how much money can we make per month? I'm not at liberty to disclose that from my company. Okay, that makes sense, no worries. But how do you invest your money? In a bank, obviously. In a bank? Yes. Where you are working? You are working in a bank or? No, no, I work in a private company. Ah, okay. So you are saving your money, not investing or? Saving, exactly, yes. You don't have any investment? Not really. Okay, but what are you saving for? In the future, obviously a house, a car.

---

## Chunk 15

**0:14:14 - 0:15:14**

You have a car? Not yet, no. You want to buy a car? Yes. But does that worth of your money to take a loan and then buy a car? I think it's worth it, but for now it's not in my plans, maybe in the future. For how much money you want to spend for a car? Not really, maybe 2,000. What is your long-term goal? To hopefully keep on studying and work at the same time, obviously, and grow higher in my position. That's great. And you know what you want to do? I think so, I'm not fully sure. I'm 21, obviously, so I don't know. But people also in their 20s, early 20s, what advice you would give to them as a personal development advice or financial? To not give up, if you're not sure about your career. Obviously, keep working hard, keep trying, keep trying new things, and eventually you'll get there, I think, so I hope. Are you in a relationship or single? I'm in a relationship. For how long? Three years. Three years. What keeps relationship longer? I think communication and respect.

## Chunk 16

**0:15:14 - 0:16:15**

If you go out for a dinner or sitting on a table, how often you are using your phone? Not very much. I forgot my friends or family or boyfriend, whatever. I leave my phone on the table and I speak. Enjoy, obviously. The other person's company. Does he work? Yes. He's making more money than you? I can't disclose that, I'm sorry. No, no, he's making more than you or you are making more than him? I think we're similar. But let's say that you are setting up family, you are starting for a serious decision, and then all of a sudden he decides to quit a job to follow his passion, which doesn't make money, which doesn't pay the bills. What would you do in that situation? I would obviously tell him that if we have family, we have obviously other things to invest in and pay. He can pursue it on the side, but obviously we have to put our family and other things first. But if he makes less money than you, would you be happy with that? I don't mind. I don't see, we're not in the olden ages

## Chunk 17

**0:16:15 - 0:17:17**

where guys have to make more money than girls. Any best piece of financial advice you would give to us? And let's give a disclaimer, you are not a financial advisor, but from your own perspectives. I would say to invest money, obviously where you think you have to invest, but also not spend everything. Be careful what you buy, what you invest in, and always check in before you invest in something you're not sure of. That's great. Thank you very much. Good luck on your career and relationship also.

He has like 24 hours daycare. So that's what I do for a living. Why did you decide for working in such job? It was your passion or what happens? No, I studied nutritional science first and I have a master's degree in it, but I work since eight years there

---

## Chunk 18

**0:17:17 - 0:18:19**

and so the salary is really, really good actually. And I have to work like six or seven days in a month and I get my salary and the rest of the time I have free time so I can follow my passion like doing martial arts and yeah, I have a lot of time for traveling, doing recovery and something like that. Being in your position, how much can we make in Germany? Right now I earn like 2,500 euros per month. For how long you want to continue with that job? Maybe for one or two years, I don't know yet. And after that, do you have any long-term plan? Yeah, I want to actually go in the career I studied for. So I want to go in quality management or something like that. But what stops you not starting to do with that? To have some fights and after I have some fights at boxing or Thai boxing, I want to start a career in my field I studied for. How do you invest your money?

---

## Chunk 19

**0:18:19 - 0:19:19**

Right now I have some ETFs, I think Global MSCI World and I spend like 100 euro per month in that. So you are getting a lot of ROI or how it works? No, I just spend money there and yeah, keep it for some years after. For people in their early 20s, they want to be financially free in today's world. What advice would you give to them? Choose a profession where you get more salary than in my job and maybe invest smart and early and keep your positions for a long time. By working for the companies, they can be financially free or how? I would rather recommend to start their own business because that's the only way to expand and have scalable income. Do you know these days what is the good business path you would take and you will make a lot of money because of the industry boom?

---

## Chunk 20

**0:19:19 - 0:20:20**

I think something with AI and yeah, definitely to do something in the internet and also you can work around the world, you don't have to stay in your country where you're from. That's great, if you go back to your 20s, all over again, starting from there, what would you do differently? Probably I would choose a study field with more economics. So I have the fury to build a business and be more independent, I guess. Thank you very much, enjoy your time. Yo guys, that's it basically. I'm definitely sure you enjoyed with this episode too.
