## Trap 1: Subscription Stacking (Invisible Fixed Costs)

Typical recurring costs (monthly):
- Subscriptions bundle: **€70–€120/month** is common when stacked (streaming, music, gym, cloud storage, apps)

Why it happens:
- Each charge feels small
- Charges are “out of sight, out of mind”
- People rarely review recurring payments

Content hook angle:
- “Your subscriptions are acting like a tiny rent.”

## Trap 2: Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) for Fashion & Tech

Typical pattern:
- BNPL is used when cash is tight, especially for clothes, sneakers, phones, and electronics.

Why it happens:
- Separates the pain of payment from the excitement of purchase
- Makes spending feel “lighter” than it is
- Multiple small installments add up

Content hook angle:
- “BNPL turns future you into the one who pays.”

---

## Trap 3: Payday Spike (First Week Spending)

Typical pattern:
- Spending increases in the first **5–7 days** after payday (food delivery, shopping, going out).

Why it happens:
- Reward behavior (“I earned it”)
- Relief after stress
- Social momentum (plans happen early in the month)

Content hook angle:
- “If you’re broke by week 3, week 1 is the suspect.”

---

## Trap 4: Micro-Leaks (Small Daily Convenience Costs)

Typical examples:
- Daily coffee/snack habits
- Delivery fees and “small extras”
- Random small purchases that don’t feel meaningful alone

Typical impact:
- Micro-leaks can quietly become **€200–€400/month** of “where did it go?” spending.

Why it happens:
- Convenience is emotionally rewarding
- Small purchases bypass budgeting attention

Content hook angle:
- “It’s not one big mistake, it’s 60 tiny ones.”

---

## Trap 5: Social Comparison & Experience Pressure

Typical pattern:
- Spending increases around travel, festivals, weekends, “everyone’s doing something” moments.

Why it happens:
- FOMO
- Identity signaling (“I’m living my life”)
- Pressure to keep up with peers

Content hook angle:
- “Comparison is an expensive subscription.”
