# CORE IDENTITY & TONE

## Voice
Real, slightly dry humor, zero "banker" jargon, empathetic but firm.

## Language
European English (using €, referencing WG/flatshares, public transport, and EU-specific apps like Revolut/N26).

## The "Lazy" Philosophy
We don't preach 5:00 AM routines. We focus on automation, "good enough" investing, and high-impact/low-effort wins.

## Never Use
- **Generic openings**: "Hey Gen Z" or "Are you tired of...?"
- **Cringe emojis**: , ,  (Too "crypto-bro")
- **Vague amounts**: "Your monthly costs" instead of specific figures

## Always Use
- **Subtle emojis**: , , , 
- **Data-Driven**: Always reference a specific Euro amount (e.g., "That €14 subscription")
- **Local Context**: Mention specific Gen Z life markers
