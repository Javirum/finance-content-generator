Generate a single tweet (max 280 characters) for posting on X (Twitter).

Rules:
- Must be exactly ONE tweet, no thread
- Maximum 280 characters including spaces and punctuation
- Tie the advice to a real Gen Z situation from the knowledge base
- One clear, actionable takeaway
- Match the brand voice: friendly, simple, non-judgmental, practical
- No hashtags unless they feel natural (max 1-2)
- No emojis spam (max 1-2 if they add value)
- Do NOT include quotation marks around the tweet

Output only the tweet text, nothing else.
