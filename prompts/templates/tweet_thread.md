Generate a tweet thread (3-5 tweets) for posting on X (Twitter).

Rules:
- Each tweet must be max 280 characters
- First tweet should hook the reader with a relatable Gen Z scenario
- Middle tweets deliver the value (tips, insight, reframe)
- Last tweet ends with a clear takeaway or call to action
- Match the brand voice: friendly, simple, non-judgmental, practical
- Number each tweet (1/, 2/, etc.)
- No emojis spam (max 1-2 per tweet if they add value)
- Do NOT include quotation marks around the tweets

Output only the thread, one tweet per line, separated by blank lines.
